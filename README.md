# THRESHOLDING
## Aim
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7
2. OpenCV

## Algorithm

### Step1:

<br>
Load the necessary packages

### Step2:

<br>
Read the Image and convert to grayscale

### Step3:


<br>
Use Global thresholding to segment the image

### Step4:

<br>
Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image

### Step5:

<br>
Use Otsu's method to segment the image and display results.

## Program

```python
# Load the necessary packages





# Read the Image and convert to grayscale




# Use Global thresholding to segment the image




# Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image




# Use Otsu's method to segment the image 




# Display the results





```
## Output

### Original Image
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Global Thresholding
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Adaptive Thresholding
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Optimum Global Thesholding using Otsu's Method
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Result
Thus the images are segmented using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and optimum global thresholding using python and OpenCV.
